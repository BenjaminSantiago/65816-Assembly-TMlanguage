# 65816-Assembly-TMlanguage
=========================
tmLanguage file for 65816 Assembly

## For Sublime Text
To install, open up Sublime Text 2, and go to Preferences->Browse Packages (on Mac, it would be Sublime Text 2->Preferences->Browse Packages)

Copy the '65816 Assembly' folder from this git repo to that folder, and enjoy your syntax highlighting!

(Planning to adapt for VSCode though that looks to use the same tm-language files)
